# Snake-B-Snake

## Description
A recreation of the classic Google Game 'Snake' but with a twist! While your snake character has to eat apples to grow, you must avoid other fruits so your snake can grow to its full length!

## Features
- Growing by consuming apples
  - This feature would be executed by having the snake gain one block in length once it passes over a fruit. The fruit would disappear and then be randomized somewhere else in the game screen.
- Shrinking by consuming trash
  - This feature would be executed by having the snake lose one block of length once it passes over the trash pile. The trash would despawn after a certain time limit or randomise somewhere else in the game screen.
- Customized by consuming other types of fruits
  - This feature would be executed by having the snake change color when it passes over a dragonfruit, gain accessories when it passes over bananas, and change body shape when it passes over blueberries. The snake will not gain length if it passes over these fruit, and the fruits will dissipate or randomize in a different location should the player decide not to collect it. 

## Challenges
- I must learn how to program the snake to increase in length when it passes over an apple.
- I must learn how to program the snake to shrink in length when it passes over a trash pile.
- I must learn how to change the snake's appearance when it passes over a dragonfruit, bananas, and blueberries.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome: 
- My ideal outcome for this project to recreate a copy of Snake but with added features where the snake can shrink or change colors, body, or have accesories.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- If the project's programming turns out to be harder than expected, than at least having the features where the snake shrinks and change colors would be a viable outcome.

## Milestones
- Week 1:
  1. Program the basic logic of snake where it is able to move around the screen based on the user's computer input.
  2. Have fruits (in this stage blocks) be able to randomize on the screen.
- Week 2:
  1. Program the snake being able to increase in one block length when it passes over the apple. The apple must disappear once the snake 'eats' it.
  2. Program the snake being able to decrease in one block length when it passes over the trash pile. The trash pile must disappear once the snake 'eats' it.
  3. Program the snake being able to change its appearance when it passes over the dragonfruit, bananas, or blueberries. The fruits must disappear when the snake 'eats' it
- Week 3:
  1. Program in images to replace the placeholders for the snake and fruits. Must have multiple options for when the snake is customized.
  2. Program the ability of the fruits disappearing if the user does not collect them in time. 
- Week 4 (Final):
  1. Clean-up and game test code to see if any debugging must be done.
