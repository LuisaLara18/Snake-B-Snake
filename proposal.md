## Description
A recreation of the classic Google Game 'Snake' but with a twist! While your snake character has to eat apples to grow, you must avoid other fruits so your snake can grow to its full length!

## Features
- Growing by consuming apples
  - This feature would be executed by having the snake gain one block in length once it passes over a fruit. The fruit would disappear and then be randomized somewhere else in the game screen.
- Shrinking by consuming trash
  - This feature would be executed by having the snake lose one block of length once it passes over the trash pile. The trash would despawn after a certain time limit or randomise somewhere else in the game screen.
- Customized by consuming other types of fruits
  - This feature would be executed by having the snake change color when it passes over a dragonfruit, gain accessories when it passes over bananas, and change body shape when it passes over blueberries. The snake will not gain length if it passes over these fruit, and the fruits will dissipate or randomize in a different location should the player decide not to collect it.
