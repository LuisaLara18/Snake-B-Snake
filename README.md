## Description
Enjoy the world-famous _Snake_ game with a twist! Instead of just eating apples to grow, you can eat **multiple** types of fruits to grow in different increments of length.
- Eating an apple grows your snake by one block.
- Eating a banana grows your snake by three blocks.
- Eating a blueberry grows your snake by five blocks.
- Eating a dragonfruit grows your snake by ten blocks.

Watch out! Beware of the many trash piles randomized throughout the screen. If you eat one by accident, you'll shrink in size! You can either shrink by one block or all the way to ten blocks!

###How to Play
Just like Google's _Snake_, you use your up, down, left, and right keyboard keys to control the movement of your snake. The goal is to grow your snake as long as possible by using the fruits to grow! However, with each fruit's randomized position, be weary of how you collect them. You can collect a fruit, grow a large increment, and immediately catapult into one of the trash piles, into yourself, or the edge of the screen, creating an instant death.

###



With all being said, have fun growing your snake in _Snake-B-Snake_!
