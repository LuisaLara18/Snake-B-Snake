## Description
Enjoy the world-famous _Snake_ game with a twist! Instead of just eating apples to grow, you can eat **multiple** types of fruits to grow in different increments of length.
- Eating an apple grows your snake by one block.
- Eating a banana grows your snake by three blocks.
- Eating a blueberry grows your snake by five blocks.
- Eating a dragonfruit grows your snake by ten blocks.

Watch out! Beware of the many trash piles randomized throughout the screen. If you eat one by accident, you'll shrink in size! You can either shrink by one block or all the way to twenty blocks!

### How to Play:
Just like Google's _Snake_, you use your up, down, left, and right keyboard keys to control the movement of your snake. The goal is to grow your snake as long as possible by using the fruits to grow! However, with each fruit's randomized position, be weary of how you collect them. You can collect a fruit, grow a large increment, and immediately catapult into one of the trash piles, into yourself, or the edge of the screen, creating an instant death.

### Snake-B-Snake Logistics:
Each file within the Snake-B-Snake repository works to show the brainstorming and mechanics of the game! The proposal.md file showed the initial idea of Snake-B-Snake, the README.md file explains the final product of the game, the requirements.txt file lists the Python libraries utilized, and the src folder contains the project Python file and game graphics. The apple, banana, blueberries, dragonfruit, trash pile, and snake graphics were all created by me in Adobe Photoshop using a pixel art style. 

In the game, each fruit is only spawned once and changes position whenever your snake collides with it. Depending on the type of fruit, it can grow either one block in length or all the way to ten blocks. The multiple trash piles also follow the same philosophy, except you can either shrink between one block to twenty blocks in length. There is no way to differentiate between with trash pile eliminates what amount of block, so it's a gamble every time you collide with one! 

There are several ways to die in the game. The main one is eating the trash piles until you either shrink in size or immediately 

### Future Areas of Improvement:




With all being said, have fun growing your snake in _Snake-B-Snake_!
